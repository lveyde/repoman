Running tests
==============

To run the tests you just have to have installed in your system a reasonable
new version of tox, and run 'tox' from the top dir of the project::

    > tox


Building the docs
==================

To build the docs, you can just run this from the root of the project::

    > tox -e docs

That will leave the docs under the path ``docs/_build/html/index.html``
